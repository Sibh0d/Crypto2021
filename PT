Sprint 5: Affine Cipher Encoder/Decoder
# Affine Cipher Encoder/Decoder
The Affine Cipher is an example of a Monoalphabetic Substituiton cipher.
The whole process relies on working _modulo_ _m_ (the length of the
alphabet used). By performing a calculation on the plaintext letters, we
encipher the plaintext.

**Encryption**
The first step in the encryption process is to transform each of the
letters in the plaintext alphabet to the corresponding integer in the
range 0 to _m_-1. With this done, the encryption process for each letter
is given by
**E(_x_) = (_ax_ + _b_) mod _m_**
where _a_ and _b_ are the key for the cipher. This means that we multiply
our integer value for the plaintext letter by _a_, and then add _b_ to the
result. Finally, we take this modulus _m_ (that is we take the remainder
when the solution is divided by _m_, or we take away the length of the
alphabet until we get a number less than this length).
As an example, let us encrypt the plaintext &quot;affine cipher&quot;, using the key
_a_ = 5, _b_ = 8. Firstly we must find the integer value of each of the
letters in the plaintext alphabet (the standard alphabet of 26 letters in
this case). The table below gives these values.

The standard values for the alphabet of 26 letters. Notice we start at 0,
not 1.
With the integer values of the plaintext letters found, the next step is
to perform the calculations on those values. In this instance, the
calculation needed is (5x+8). Finally, we must ensure that all our
answers are calculated mod 26 and convert the integers back to ciphertext
letters. All this information is shown in the table below.

The affine cipher with a = 5, b = 8. We work out values of letters, then
do the calculations, before converting numbers back to letters.
Thus the ciphertext produced is &quot;IHHWVC SWFRCP&quot;.
**Decryption**
In deciphering the ciphertext, we must perform the opposite (or inverse)
functions on the ciphertext to retrieve the plaintext. Once again, the
first step is to convert each of the ciphertext letters into their
integer values. We must now perform the following calculation on each
integer

**D(_x_) = _c_(_x_ - _b_) mod _m_**
where _c_ is the modular multiplicative inverse of _a_. That is, _a_ x _c_
= 1 mod _m_ (_c_ is the number such that when you multiply a by it, and
keep taking away the length of the alphabet, you get to 1).
Continuing our example, we shall decrypt the ciphertext &quot;IHHWVC SWFRCP&quot;,
using a key of _a_ = 5, _b_ = 8. The first step here is to find the
inverse of _a_, which in this case is 21 (since 21 x 5 = 105 = 1 mod 26,
as 26 x 4 = 104, and 105 - 104 = 1). We must now perform the inverse
calculations on the integer values of the ciphertext. In this case the
calculation in 21(_y_ - 8). Once again, we must take these answers modulo
26, and finally convert the integers back to plaintext letters. This is
shown in the table below.

The decryption process for a key of a = 5, b = 8. We had to find the
inverse of a first, which is 21.
We retrieve our plaintext of &quot;affine cipher&quot;.
